# Debian Debootstrap Install
this is the documentation for debian debootstrap install (Debian 13)
\
why debootstrap? debootstrap allow you to get the most minimal install in debian. furthermore, it is installed fully within terminal, giving you an arch install-like experience.
\
what I mean with "the most minimal install" is the fact that even systemd won't get installed automatically (if you use minbase variant). If you want to install other init in debian (sysvinit/openrc) this is the "safest" way
\
for rollback, refer to https://www.dwarmstrong.org/btrfs-snapshots-rollbacks/
gotta make the documentation later
